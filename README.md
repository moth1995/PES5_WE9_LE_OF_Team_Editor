# PES5_WE9_LE_OF_Team_Editor
A simple tool to edit the saga game option file and swap teams, maybe sooner it will become even more useful

Hi guys! 


I've had read that @Fenomeno9 was in need of a tool to continue with his work for his option files / patches (https://evo-web.co.uk/threads/pes-5-of-for-2001-02-season.82943/page-4#post-3652830) and this tool was on my mind because is part of a future project i have, so i started working on this first since it will be easier


Until today this tool can do the following things


-Swap teams:

    Players relink for the two club teams
    Players dorsal/jersey number for the two club teams
    Club teams names
    Club teams 3 letter names
    Club teams data formation (such as captain kicker, strategy, attacking settings, position in the field, etc)

It has support for the 3 mentioned games, but you'll need to test, remember always make backup of your OPTION FILE!!!


In the future i'll add more options (i believe)
